/**
 * Allows you to delete or archive documents that have reached a specific age. By default, documents are deleted when 
 * they expire. If you want to archive them instead, specify the name of the database you want to use for archiving in 
 * the <strong>ExpireIntoDatabase</strong> parameter in each of the IDOL server configuration file's database sections.
 * <p />
 * The date that determines whether a document should be expired can be read from a field in the document or from the 
 * expiry time that is set for the database that contains the document. If IDOL server is unable to determine whether a 
 * document should be expired (because the document does not contain a field that sets its expiry date and the 
 * document's database has no expiry time set), IDOL server does not expire the document.
