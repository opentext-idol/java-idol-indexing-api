/**
 * Allows you to reduce the space left when documents in IDOL server's data index are deleted. The <strong>DRECOMPACT
 * </strong> command fills the space created through the document deletion with new documents. (This is similar to the
 * defragmentation process). Once the compact is complete, the command recalculates the <strong>SortField</strong>
 * information.
 * <p />
 * By default, the <strong>DRECOMPACT</strong> command automatically copies the data index to the <strong>internalbackup
 * </strong> directory in the IDOL server's data directory. To change this directory, set the <em>
 * PreCompactionBackupPath</em> configuration parameter.
