# java-idol-indexing-api

This is a Java API for indexing documents into IDOL servers.

## About
IDOL servers use an index port for indexing content. This library provides a Java API for performing this task.

Previous versions were available as jar files from customer support.

## Usage
java-idol-indexing-api is available from the central Maven repository.

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.hp.autonomy.idol</groupId>
        <artifactId>indexing-api</artifactId>
        <version>3.2.0</version>
    </dependency>

The primary means of interaction is the IndexingService. An IndexingServiceImpl can either be created with the host and index 
port for an IDOL server, or the executeAction method must be called with a host and port each time.

    final IndexingService indexingService = new IndexingServiceImpl(
        new DefaultHttpClient(),
        new ServerDetails(host, port)
    );

Subclasses of IndexCommand are used to send index commands. For example, to create a DREADD command:

    final IndexCommand command = new DreAddCommand();
    command.setIndexFile("/path/to/my/file");

To execute this command, the IndexingService executeCommand method should be called with the action. The index id of the
index job is returned.

    final int indexId = indexingService.executeCommand(command);

Use the [Java ACI API](https://github.com/opentext-idol/java-aci-api-ng) to track the status of the job.

## Migration to FOSS Version
